F﻿or safety reasons Grayson Sanitation has delayed start time until 7:30 instead of the usual 5:00 am.  The roads are still slick. They will start in town and in areas on flat ground. They will need to hold off on inclined & areas with hills until road crews have a chance to scrape & treat them. They are attempting the Wednesday routes today, 2/20/25.  Please understand there will be some places that are unable to be picked up.
