The Grayson Utilities Commission's Cast Iron Water line Replacement project will begin on Monday, April 21, 2025.

The construction will be starting at 4th Street at Carol Malone and go one block to Pomeroy Street. Then on Pomeroy Street to Main Street (US 60).

The Utility Commission advises motorist of intermittent closures, delays and to use alternate routes.

Motorists need to be aware of the work zone, expect delays, and utilize safe driving habits when traveling through the area.

The date, time, and duration of work may be adjusted if inclement weather, or other unforeseen delays occur.
