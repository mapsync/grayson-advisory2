The entire Grayson Water System is experiencing a water outage due to a power outage at the treatment plant.  We DO NOT have an estimated time that the power will return to our treatment plant.  Once the power is restored the plant will begin to send drinking water into the system.  It will take time for the system to build back up.  You will be under a boil water advisory once water is restored until further notice.
