The contractors are working on cleaning up the area of the rehab project and doing repairs as needed.  They are NOT finished, so don't panic if you have a mess in your yard or in the road.  They worked steadily, making their way through the area, and should be finished by the end of March as planned, foreseeing any problems.  

Another question that has come up regarding yard and road repairs:  The contractors will be repairing any and all yards they have damaged, the sewer clean-outs sticking up in your yard will be cut off at ground level and a concrete collar placed around it, and the roads that got damaged are going to be blacktopped.  

The contractors do not get all of their money for the project until everything has been repaired and/or completed as per their contract.  So, if you have any questions or concerns, or if something did not get repaired back to the way it was before they started, please call the office at 606-474-7569 for assistance. 

Thank you for your continued patience as we are still in the construction phase of the sewer rehab project.  Also be sure to watch this app and our web site to stay informed of work areas, road closings, outages and boil waters, even after this project is finished.  You can also pay your bill and see a map of the area of work being done and determine if your residence is in the mapped area, all through this app.  If you have any suggestions for information you would like to see on this app, please call the office at the number below. 

For any other questions or concerns, call the Grayson Utilities office at 606-474-7569 or after hours at 606-474-5731.
