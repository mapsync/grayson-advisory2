  FOR MAY 19TH, 2025

Monday, May 19th work will begin on Pomeroy Street to patch the disturbed asphalt.  Pomeroy Street from Main Street will be closed.

Also taking place today, customers on 4th street will be connected to the newly installed Main Waterline. A brief service interruption will occur during the connection work.  However, the affected customers will NOT be on a boil water advisory.  This new line has been successfully tested and sampled and ready for use.  Customers that have been connected to the new line may notice air and more noise when they initially use the water the first time after being connected.  This should be brief and will quit upon usage.

The Utility Commission advises motorists to use alternate routes.

The Utility Commission asks motorists to be aware of the work zone, expect delays, and utilize safe driving habits when traveling through the area.

The date, time, and duration of work may be adjusted if inclement weather or other unforeseen delays occur.
