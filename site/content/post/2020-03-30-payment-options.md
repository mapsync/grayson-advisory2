Grayson Utilities Commission wants to encourage our customers to make your payment without visiting our office if possible.  The following resources are available.

**Call Customer Service at 606-474-7569 during business hours 8-4 (Monday-Friday) to pay with debit/credit card.  NO DEBIT/CREDIT CARD PAYMENTS WILL BE ACCEPTED IN THE DRIVE-THRU.**

**Mail in payments.  For you convenience an envelope is provided in your monthly bill.**

**Leave a payment in our on-site drop box 24/7.**

**Call Customer Service to set up automatic bank draft.**

**Visit our website at www.graysonutilities.com to make online payments.**

Our drive-thru services will still be available but could have long wait times since our lobby remains closed to the public.  Should you have any questions please call Customer Service at 606-474-7569.
