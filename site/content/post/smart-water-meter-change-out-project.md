As part of the Grayson Utilities smart water project, old water meters will be changed out with new ones. Integrity Water and Energy along with Advanced Utility Systems are leading this work for the Grayson Utilities Commission. They will start the week of June 6, 2022, and work through November 2022. When possible, you will be notified in person prior to the meter change or if you are not home a door hanger explaining your meter has been changed with contact information if there are any questions or concerns. Thanks in advance for your corporation with this effort and if you have any immediate questions or concerns, please contact Justin Prather with Integrity Water and Energy at 812-646-5588.
