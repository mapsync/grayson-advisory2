description: Gas outage around Nursing Home area
---
If you do not have gas service to your home the reason is that we had to shut the gas valve off for some unexpected repairs to a gas line in the following areas:  McDavid Blvd, Hugh St, Barrett St, Woods Drive, Woodcrest Rd, Poplar Heights Drive, Rose St, Beech St, Violet Dr, Griffith St, Marshall Ave, and Bradford St.  This includes the Nursing Home and Trimble Lodge.

To get your gas back on you need to call the office at 606-474-7569 M-F 8-4, or after hours you can call 606-474-5731.  You will need to provide the name on the account, service address, valid telephone number, and know if your appliances have automatic pilot lights or if you can light your own pilot lights.  Someone must be home, and if you are unsure about your pilot lights, our utility worker will need to come in to relight your pilot light(s) after turning the gas meter back on.

We apologize for any inconvenience and we will get your gas back on as soon as we can.

Thank you

GUC
