description: Gas outage around Nursing Home area
---
If you do not have gas service to your home the reason is that we had to shut the gas valve off for some unexpected repairs to a gas line in the following areas:  McDavid Blvd, Hugh St, Woods Drive, Woodcrest Rd, Poplar Heights Drive, Rose St, Beech St, Violet Dr, Griffith St, Marshall Ave, and Bradford St.  This includes the Nursing Home and Trimble Lodge.

To get your gas back on you need to call the office at 606-474-7569 M-F 8-4, or after hours you can call 606-474-5731.  Someone must be home to let the utility worker in to relight your pilot light(s) after turning the gas meter back on.

We apologize for any inconvenience and we will get your gas back on as soon as we can.

Thank you
