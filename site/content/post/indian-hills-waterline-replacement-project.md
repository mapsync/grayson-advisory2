The City of Grayson Utilities Commission has a Waterline Replacement Project that is about to start in your neighborhood. 

This project consists of replacing existing waterlines and is being done to eliminate the service outages that have been occurring where the road has slipped.  As work is being done you may experience some service outages but every effort will be made to keep those to a minimum.  

Utility Environmental Concepts, LLC will be the contractor performing the waterline replacement work.  Work is scheduled to begin on Monday, November 23rd, 2020.

Areas affected will be Indian Hills, Cherokee Drive and Blackfoot Lane.

If you have any questions or comments please call Gerald W Haney, Utility Superintendent at (606) 474-7569.
