message: The entire Grayson Water System is experiencing a water outage due to a
  power outage at the treatment plant.  We Do NOT have a estimated time that the
  power will return to our treatment plant.  Once the power is restored the
  plant will begin to send drinking water into the system.  It will take time
  for the system to build back up.  Once your water is restored you will be
  under a boil water advisory until further notice.
