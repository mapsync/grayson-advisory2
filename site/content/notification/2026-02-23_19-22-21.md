message: Our online payment processing has recently updated. Please be sure to
  close your browser or window after receiving your confirmation number. This
  will ensure that your payment is not duplicated. Also when entering the
  expiration date from your card do not enter any dashes between the month and
  year. Example (0226) is the way this should look. We apologize for any errors
  that have occurred, but this should fix any further issues.
